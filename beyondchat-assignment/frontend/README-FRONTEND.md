# 🎨 BeyondChats Assignment - Frontend Dashboard (Phase 3)

This is the **Client-Side Application** for the Full Stack Intern Assignment.
It is a modern, responsive dashboard built with **React + Vite** and styled using **Tailwind CSS**.

The dashboard serves as a visualization layer for the Backend API, offering a **Split-View Comparison Mode** to analyze Original Scraped Articles vs. AI-Enhanced Content side-by-side.

* Allows distinct visual comparison of formatting and content depth.

### 2. 🎨 Professional UI/UX
* **Clean Aesthetic:** Minimalist design using a cool color palette (Indigos, Blues, Purples).
* **Visual Indicators:** Color-coded badges and borders to distinguish between data sources instantly.
* **Responsive Grid:** Adapts seamlessly from mobile (stacked) to desktop (side-by-side).

### 3. 🚀 Real-Time Interaction
* **Live Data Fetching:** Connects to the Backend API (`http://localhost:3001`) to fetch latest data.
* **HTML Rendering:** Safely renders rich-text content (headings, paragraphs) generated by the Gemini AI.
* **Loading & Error States:** User-friendly skeletons and error messages if the backend is down.

Dashboard Overview (Split Mode)
Visualizing Original vs AI-Enhanced articles in a dual-grid layout.

(Note: Ensure you have run POST /scrape and node scripts/runAssignment.js to populate both sides of the grid)

🧩 Component Architecture
The application logic is centralized in App.jsx for simplicity (given the assignment scope), but cleanly separated into:

State Management: useState for articles, loading, and error states.

Data Fetching: useEffect triggers an Axios call on mount.

Filtering Logic: Data is filtered client-side into originalArticles and aiArticles arrays.

Reusable UI: ArticleCard component handles the display logic for individual items, accepting props for dynamic styling (Blue vs Purple).

🛡️ Integration Details
API Endpoint: GET http://localhost:3001/api/articles

HTML Parsing: Uses dangerouslySetInnerHTML to render the HTML tags (<h2>, <p>, <ul>) returned by the AI, ensuring the formatting is preserved in the UI.
